# Create a method called “greeting” that asks the user to input their name 
# and returns a new String when we call (or ‘invoke’) that method that includes the name 
#provided.
# For example:

=begin

If the user enters “Chris” as a name, the output would be:

... >

Please enter your name!

 Chris

 Oh, hello Chris!

=> nil
...
=end
#they probably wanted a gets method!

def greeting
    puts "Please enter your name!" 
    input = gets.chomp.capitalize
    puts "Oh, hello #{input}!"
end
greeting
